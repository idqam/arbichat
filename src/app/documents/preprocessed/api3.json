API3 provides the technology for [Airnodes](https://docs.api3.org/reference/airnode/latest/understand/) to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts. This data can then be queried directly through the Airnode (initiating a “pull-type” request) or through [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/) (data-feeds sourced directly from multiple first-party oracles owned and operated by API providers). ### Querying the price of $ARB through API3\n\nHere’s an example of how to use an API3 data feed to query the current price of $ARB on-chain. The [API3 market](https://market.api3.org/arbitrum) provides a list of all the dAPIs available across multiple chains including testnets. You can go forward and activate the dAPI you want to use."

      "content": "API3 provides an npm package with the contracts needed to access their feeds. We first install that package in our project:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @api3/contracts\n```\n\nTo use a data feed, we retrieve the information through the specific proxy address for that feed. We’ll use the IProxy interface to do so. ```solidity\nimport \"@api3/contracts/api3-server-v1/proxies/interfaces/IProxy.sol\";\n```\n\nIn this case, we want to obtain the current price of $ARB in $USD in Arbitrum One, so we need to know the proxy address that will provide that information. We will search the feed on the API3 Market and connect our wallet. We would then want to see if the feed is active, and if it is, we can check its configuration parameters, deploy the proxy contract and click on `Integrate.` You can find the proxy address of ARB/USD [here](https://market.api3.org/arbitrum?search=ARB%2FUSD). :::info\nIf a dAPI is already active, you can use the proxy address directly. If it is not active, you can activate it by clicking on `Activate` and following the instructions to deploy a proxy contract. :::\n\nWe can now build the function to get the latest price of $ARB."

Just remember to use the address of the asset you want to request the price for in the appropriate network and to **deploy your contract to the same network**. Remember we have a [Quickstart](/build-decentralized-apps/01-quickstart-solidity-remix.mdx) available that goes through the process of compiling and deploying a contract."

      "content": "### Querying a random number through API3\n\n[API3 QRNG](https://docs.api3.org/explore/qrng/) is a public utility provided with the courtesy of [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/). It is served as a public good, it is free of charge (apart from the gas costs), and it provides quantum randomness when requiring RNG on-chain. To request randomness on-chain, the requester submits a request for a random number to `AirnodeRrpV0`. The ANU Airnode gathers the request from the `AirnodeRrpV0` protocol contract, retrieves the random number off-chain, and sends it back to `AirnodeRrpV0`. Once received, it performs a callback to the requester with the random number. Here’s an example of a basic `QrngRequester` that requests a random number. API3 provides an npm package with the contracts needed to access the ANU QRNG airnode. We first install that package in our project:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @api3/airnode-protocol\n```\n\nWe’ll need several pieces of data to request a random number:\n\n* `address airnodeRrp`: Address of the protocol contract. See the [Chains](https://docs.api3.org/reference/qrng/chains.html) page for a list of addresses on different chains."

See the [Providers](https://docs.api3.org/reference/qrng/providers.html) page for a list of addresses on different chains. For Arbitrum we’ll use `0x9d3C147cA16DB954873A498e0af5852AB39139f2`. * `bytes32 endpointId`: Endpoint ID known by the Airnode that will map to an API provider call (allowed to be `bytes32(0)`). You can also find that information in the [Providers](https://docs.api3.org/reference/qrng/providers.html) page. For Arbitrum we’ll use `0xfb6d017bb87991b7495f563db3c8cf59ff87b09781947bb1e417006ad7f55a78`. * `address sponsorWallet`: The address of the wallet that will pay for the gas costs for the callback request to get the random number on-chain. You need to fund this wallet with enough ETH to cover the gas costs."
