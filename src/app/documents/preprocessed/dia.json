With a novel architecture aggregating raw trade data directly from first-party sources, namely centralized and decentralized exchanges, DIA offers 100% source transparency, bespoke customization, and chain-native asset price feeds. You can find an example on how to use DIA in your project on this [page](https://docs.diadata.org/introduction/intro-to-dia-oracles/request-an-oracle). ### How to use DIA oracles on Arbitrum\n\n**Requesting a custom oracle**: DIA deploys oracles tailored to each dApp’s needs. Each oracle is customizable, including data sources, cleansing filters, pricing, computational methodologies, update mechanisms, and more."

Here is an example of how to access a price value on DIA oracles:\n\n1. Access your custom oracle smart contract on Arbitrum. 2. Call `getValue(pair_name)` with `pair_name` being the full pair name such as `BTC/USD`. You can use the \"Read\" section on the explorer to execute this call. 3. The response of the call contains two values:\n\n* The current asset price in USD with a fix-comma notation of 8 decimals. * The UNIX timestamp of the last oracle update."
