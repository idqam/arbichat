This guide will walk you through the process of implementing a gasless transaction to mint an NFT on Arbitrum. ### 1. Import the NFT Contract\n\nFirst, you need to import the smart contract you'll be interacting with. In this case, we'll use an NFT contract with a 'mint' function."

Set up the Gas Policy\n\nCreate a new policy to sponsor gas fees for users:\n\n```shell\ncurl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/policies \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n  -d chainId=42161 \\\n  -d name=\"Arbitrum NFT Sponsor\" \\\n  -d \"strategy[sponsorSchema]=pay_for_user\"\n```\n\nThen, add a policy rule for the NFT contract:\n\n```shell\ncurl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/policies/:id/policy_rules \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY\" \\\n  -d type=\"contract_functions\" \\\n  -d functionName=\"mint\" \\\n  -d contract=\"con_...\"\n```\n\nReplace `:id` with the policy ID returned from the previous step, and `con_...` with your contract ID. ### 3."

The user can now mint an NFT without needing to hold ETH for gas fees. Remember to handle the response from the `transactionIntents.create` call in your application to provide feedback to the user about the minting process. :::info Detailed tutorial\n\nFor a more detailed tutorial, please refer to the [<ins>Openfort Quick Start Guide</ins>](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/getting-started)."
